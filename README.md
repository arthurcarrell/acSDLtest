# My first ever SDL project

I was pratically just following this tutorial:
https://examples.libsdl.org/SDL3/renderer/01-clear/

but im going to use this as a template for all of my other projects that use SDL3 and update this project template as I get better and find out good praticses and inevitably find some bad ones too.

 ### TODO:
    - Change the SIN wave fade to use RGBA (0-255) instead of floating point RGBA.
    - Mess around with header files?


Also, before you completely judge my code, this is one of my first times using C++ (and also the first time using makefiles but they are basically just bash so im not sure that counts.)
